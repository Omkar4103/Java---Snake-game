# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game implemented in Java using Swing.

## Game Description

The Snake Game is a classic video game where the player controls a snake and tries to eat apples while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own body. The snake grows longer every time it eats an apple, making it progressively harder to avoid collisions.

## Features

- Snake movement: The player can control the snake's direction using the arrow keys.
- Apple generation: Apples are randomly generated on the game board for the snake to eat.
- Scoring: The player's score increases every time the snake eats an apple.
- Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
